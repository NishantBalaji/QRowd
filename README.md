## Setup
Your machine will need flask, pymongo, json, geocoder, mapbox, and dotenv to run this code. To get any of these libraries, you can just `pip install [insert library here]` in a terminal window. To run the code, first pull the github to your computer and then navigate to the folder where app.py is. Then open terminal and run the command `flask run`. This will direct you to a localhost website where you can interact with the product.

### Detailed Instructions:
1. Open command prompt
2. Install flask, pymongo, dns, json, and bson using `pip install [library name]`
3. Then download the github repo to your computer
4. Locate the repo in your file explorer
   -- Open command prompt from that folder's search bar by typing cmd into it
5. Then enter `flask run` in the command prompt
6. Copy the localhost link that is outputted and paste it into a web browser
7. Use the application in your browser
